Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to analyze employee attrition patterns within the organization to identify key factors contributing to turnover and to inform retention strategies.

Data Sources:
The analysis utilized data from HR records, employee surveys, and performance metrics. Key variables included demographics, tenure, job satisfaction scores, performance ratings, and exit interview feedback.

Methodology:
Using Power BI, I created a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes attrition trends over time, segmented by department, role, and demographic factors. The project involved the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensured the dataset was accurate and complete, addressing any inconsistencies or missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover initial insights into attrition rates and trends.

Visualizations: Developed interactive visualizations, including:

Line charts showing attrition rates over time.
Bar charts comparing attrition rates across different departments and roles.
Key Metrics Dashboard: Created a metrics dashboard highlighting:

Outcome:
The Power BI dashboard provided HR leaders with actionable insights into attrition patterns. By identifying high-risk departments and key factors influencing turnover, the organization was better equipped to develop targeted retention strategies, ultimately aiming to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates.

Impact:
The project significantly contributed to data-driven decision-making in HR practices and helped foster a proactive approach to employee retention, leading to a more engaged workforce.

Tools Used:
Power BI, Power Query, DAX
